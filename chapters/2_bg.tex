\section{Emulating regional climate models}

% Do I stick to just climate model emulation or do I also cover observation based climate downscaling? and also related applications like weather forecasting (that may or may not also involve downscaling)?

GCMs, Dynamical Downscaling, RCMs, CPMs

Statistical and ML Downscaling



\section{ML, computer vision, super-resolution and downscaling}

Leading to U-Net on the deterministic side but also the need for stochastic models

\subsection{Deep Generative Models}

Inherently stochastic problem so generative models offer a way to model that stochastic element.

* Auto-regressive
* Normalizing flow
* VAE
* GAN
* Diffusion
